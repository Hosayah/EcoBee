## EcoBee

A desktop spelling bee game about environmental sustainability.

## Project Objective:

The goal of this spelling bee program is to promote users to lessen their carbon footprint by expanding their knowledge about terminologies related to the environment.

## Project Target User: 

Students will learn about environmental concepts and terminology in an exciting yet challenging manner, boosting their vocabulary and increasing their understanding of sustainable behaviors. In addition to the NSTP curriculum, teachers can develop a culture of learning and responsibility by using the game as an engaging tool for environmental education.

## Project Features: 
•	Graphical User Interface - This program will have a straightforward desktop user interface. This will make it easier for users to navigate throughout the app. <br>
•	Spelling Game – A spelling bee game will be included in the app, where users must hear a word, read its meaning, and guess its spelling in a set amount of time. <br>
•	Game Difficulty - There will be three difficulty levels, each of which increases the difficulty of the words generated. Higher difficulty equals higher scores. <br>
•	Timer - A timer starts at 15 seconds; the game ends when the timer runs out. During the game, if the countdown is greater than 6 seconds, it is decreased to 3 seconds for every 5 correct spellings. <br>
•	User high score - The game will track progress and high scores, instilling a sense of accomplishment and long-term engagement. <br>
•	Leaderboard - The game have a leaderboard, ranking players based on their high scores. <br>
•	Pause - A pause button is included to allow the players to take a break when needed. <br>
•	Confirmation Dialog - For actions that require confirmation, such closing the software or playing the game again after losing, a dialog box will appear. This reduces unwanted or unintentional actions. <br>
